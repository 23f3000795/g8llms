## 🔍 Key Findings

### **1. Extreme Variability in Scores**
- Q1 is critically low (0.74), indicating severe operational or service issues.
- Q3 and Q4 exceed the industry target by a substantial margin.
- Variability suggests **inconsistent patient experience**.

### **2. Above-Benchmark Annual Performance (Despite Instability)**
- The calculated average satisfies the 4.5 target.
- However, the volatility indicates **unreliable service quality**, risking long-term satisfaction and patient trust.

### **3. Strong but Unstable Recovery in H2**
- Q2 onward shows significant improvement.
- This suggests corrective actions had impact—but may not be standardized or sustainable.

## 🏥 Business Implications

### **1. Operational Risk**
Large swings in satisfaction scores imply inconsistent staffing, service quality, or patient wait times.

### **2. Financial Consequences**
Lower satisfaction correlates with:
- Reduced patient retention  
- Lower HCAHPS incentive payments  
- Potential reputational impact  

### **3. Strategic Importance**
To maintain competitive position and meet organizational KPIs, stabilizing patient experience is essential.
